/**
 * 1. Implement a caching fetch hook. The hook should return an object with the following properties:
 * - isLoading: a boolean that is true when the fetch is in progress and false otherwise
 * - data: the data returned from the fetch, or null if the fetch has not completed
 * - error: an error object if the fetch fails, or null if the fetch is successful
 *
 * This hook is called three times on the client:
 *  - 1 in App.tsx
 *  - 2 in Person.tsx
 *  - 3 in Name.tsx
 *
 * Acceptance Criteria:
 * 1. The application at /appWithoutSSRData should properly render, with JavaScript enabled, you should see a list of people.
 * 2. You should only see 1 network request in the browser's network tab when visiting the /appWithoutSSRData route.
 * 3. You have not changed any code outside of this file to achieve this.
 * 4. This file passes a type-check.

 * 3.2 Implement an initializeCache function that initializes the cache from a serialized cache string.
 *
 * Together, these two functions will help the framework transfer your cache to the browser.
 *
 * The framework will call `serializeCache` on the server to serialize the cache to a string and inject it into the dom.
 * The framework will then call `initializeCache` on the browser with the serialized cache string to initialize the cache.
